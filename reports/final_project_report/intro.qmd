# Introduction to the Project

## Overview
Brain tumor detection from MRI images is a critical and challenging task in medical diagnosis,
as early and accurate identification of tumors can significantly improve patient outcomes. Manual
analysis of MRI images is time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability, highlighting the need
for automated approaches to assist medical practitioners and enhance the efficiency of their workflow.

## Objective

This project aims to develop a machine learning-based system capable of detecting brain tumors in MRI images
with high accuracy, which could potentially enable the general public to upload their MRI scans and receive
feedback on the presence of tumors. It is important to develop such a program because as addressed in introduction,
it is time-consuming for manual detection so by using such a model, it can increase and maximize efficiency of
brain tumor detection for both hospitality infrastructure and patients.
