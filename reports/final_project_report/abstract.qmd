# Abstract {.unnumbered}

In this study, we investigate the application of two prominent deep learning architectures, ResNet50 and VGG-19, for the detection of brain tumors in MRI images using Python. Our objective is to build and compare the performance of these models for accurate and reliable brain tumor diagnosis. We employ a comprehensive dataset of MRI images, including both healthy and tumor-affected brain scans, to train and evaluate the models. The ResNet50 and VGG-19 models are fine-tuned with custom layers and hyperparameters for optimal performance. In addition to model training, we perform hyperparameter optimization and visualization of evaluation metrics such as the ROC curve, accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix for both models. Our findings demonstrate the potential of utilizing deep learning techniques, specifically ResNet50 and VGG-19 architectures, in aiding clinical decision-making by providing accurate and automated brain tumor detection from MRI images.
