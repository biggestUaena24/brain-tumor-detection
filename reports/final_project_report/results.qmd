# Results

## Description of the Models

Both VGG-19 and ResNet50 are a type of CNN pre-trained model that we are using in this project. In this section, we are going to sepcify the performance and some graphs that we are getting from the result of the training and testing.

## Performance Metrics

Some of the performance metrics that we are testing on the models are:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- AUC
- ROC Curve

## Visualization

This are some of the images that we are getting from the ResNet50 model.

This are some of the images that we are getting from the VGG-19 model.

<img src="./images/vgg_roc.png" width="400" height="400" />


## Interpretation of the Results 

Through all the visualization that we are providing, we can clearly see that VGG-19 model has a better result in ROC curve and in the confusion matrix. However, the accuracy and loss of the ResNet50 model similiar to the VGG-19 model. Due to these reasons, we are going to choose the VGG-19 model as our final model.
